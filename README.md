# ⚙️ Engineering Systems Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of engineering projects and system implementations that combine software, hardware, and control logic into complete, working solutions.

The focus is on building real systems — not isolated code snippets or small demos — but practical designs that move from concept to prototype to tested implementation. Each project is approached with an engineering workflow: define requirements → design → build → test → refine → document.

Across this work you’ll find applications of:

🔹 Embedded and firmware development  
🔹 Electronics and PCB design  
🔹 Python tools and backend services  
🔹 Data processing and system integration  
🔹 Automation and control systems  

Emphasis is placed on clean architecture, efficient code, reliable hardware, and clear documentation. Solutions are designed to be understandable, reproducible, and maintainable, reflecting real-world engineering practices.

This repository serves as a technical workspace and portfolio — a place where ideas are turned into functional systems and continuously improved through experimentation and iteration.

🚀 Build. Test. Improve. Repeat.
